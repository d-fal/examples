<h3>AVFrame manipulation by opencv</h3>

FFMPEG is a peerless fantastic tool for video processing. Sometimes, we need to process the frames in practices like <em>Image Processing</em> and <em>Machine vision</em>. <br>
What we need is magnicifent openCV. Although openCV comes with internal video support, it is not as complete as ffmpeg. Sometimes, one have to re-invent the wheel.<br>

The provided code is based on ffmpeg transcoding and encoding examples of ffmpeg where you can find them <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/2.8/examples.html">Here</a>. <br>
This code is provided for experimental purposes and I ask you to improve it in every aspect you like.
